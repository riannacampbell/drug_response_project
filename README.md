# Colon Cancer Drug Response Prediction
**`UC Berkeley C242 Machine Learning Final Project`**

Dataset: This [Colon Cancer Multitargeted Drug Discovery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmer3/colon-cancer-multitargeted-drug-discovery-dataset) integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from 7,643 patients and focuses on multitargeted drug discovery in colon cancer.

Key features:
- Gene expression data: Expression levels of key genes linked to colon cancer
- Protein interaction scores: Quantitative interaction scores from protein networks
- Pathway alterations: Categorical values indicating pathway dysregulation
- Drug response: Measures of drug efficacy (target variable)

Project Goal: Use gene expression, protein interaction scores, and pathway alterations as input features to predict drug response as an output.

Machine Learning Methods: 
TBD
